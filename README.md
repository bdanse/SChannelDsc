This is the development branch to which contributions should be proposed by
contributors as pull requests. This development branch will periodically be
merged to the master branch, and be released to the
[PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/).

## Installation

To manually install the module, download the source code and unzip the contents
of the \Modules\SChannelDsc directory to the
$env:ProgramFiles\WindowsPowerShell\Modules folder

To install from the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/SChannelDsc) using PowerShellGet (in PowerShell 5.0)
run the following command:

```PowerShell
Find-Module -Name SChannelDsc -Repository PSGallery | Install-Module
```

To confirm installation, run the below command and ensure you see the
SharePoint DSC resoures available:

```PowerShell
Get-DscResource -Module SChannelDsc
```

## Requirements

The minimum PowerShell version required is 4.0, which ships in Windows 8.1
or Windows Server 2012R2 (or higher versions). The preferred version is
PowerShell 5.0 or higher, which ships with Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016.
This is discussed [on the SChannelDsc wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/SChannelDsc/wiki/Remote%20sessions%20and%20the%20InstallAccount%20variable),
but generally PowerShell 5 will run the SChannel DSC resources faster and
with improved verbose level logging.

## Documentation and examples

For a full list of resources in SChannelDsc and examples on their use, check
out the [SChannelDsc wiki](https://github.com/Microsoft/SChannelDsc/wiki).
You can also review the "examples" directory in the SChannelDsc module for
some general use scenarios for all of the resources that are in the module.
